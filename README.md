DoseFlow: Medicine Tracker App

Tagline: Your health, on schedule.
1. Core Problem

Keeping track of multiple medications can be challenging. Patients often forget to take their medicine on time, miss doses, or lose track of their medication history. This can lead to decreased treatment effectiveness and potential health complications. DoseFlow aims to solve this by providing a simple, intuitive, and reliable tool to manage medication schedules.
2. Key Features (MVP)

These are the essential features for the first version of the app.
2.1. Medication Management

    Add New Medication: Users can add a medicine by entering its name, dosage (e.g., 500mg, 1 tablet), and form (e.g., pill, liquid, injection).

    Edit/Delete Medication: Users can modify details of existing medications or remove them.

2.2. Scheduling & Reminders

    Flexible Scheduling: Set schedules for each medication:

        Daily (at specific times)

        Specific days of the week (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri)

        "As needed" (for non-scheduled medication)

    Push Notifications: The app will send timely reminders to the user's device when it's time to take a dose.

2.3. Dose Logging

    Track Doses: For each notification, users can mark the dose as:

        Taken: Confirms the dose was taken.

        Skipped: Confirms the dose was missed.

    Log Notes: Optionally add a note to a logged dose (e.g., "Took with food").

2.4. History & Adherence

    Medication History: A simple log showing a chronological list of all taken and skipped doses.

    Adherence Score: A basic percentage showing how consistently the user is taking their medication over the last 30 days.

3. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

Features to consider for future versions to add more value.

    Refill Reminders: Track the number of pills remaining and notify the user when it's time for a refill.

    Caregiver Mode: Allow a family member or caregiver to monitor and manage the medication schedule for someone else.

    Exportable Reports: Generate and share medication adherence reports with doctors via PDF or email.

    Inventory Tracking: Manage medication stock levels.

    Drug Interaction Checker: (Requires API integration) Warn users about potential interactions between their medications.

4. Potential Technology Stack

    Frontend (Mobile):

        React Native or Flutter for cross-platform (iOS & Android) development.

    Backend & Database:

        Firebase (Firestore for database, Authentication for users, Cloud Messaging for notifications).

    UI/UX Design:

        A clean, minimalist design focusing on ease of use and accessibility. High-contrast colors and large, clear fonts are essential.
